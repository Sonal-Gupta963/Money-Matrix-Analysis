#  Money Matrix Analysis – Financial Data Analysis & Dashboard

**Money Matrix** is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboard project focused on financial metrics such as loans, deposits, and customer behavior. This project combines tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze, structure, and visualize data insights effectively.


## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 Excel
- Used for initial **data gathering and preparation**.
- Source files stored and cleaned before loading into SQL.

### 🔹 SQL (MySQL)
- Used to **create the database schema** and load data.
- Connected to Python using the `mysql-connector` package.
- Performed light data querying and filtering before EDA.

### 🔹 Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using:
  - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Focused on identifying trends in **loan issuance**, **deposits**, and **customer segmentation**.

### 🔹 Power BI
- Final data storytelling and visualization layer.
- Dashboard contains **3 pages**:
  1. **Home** – Overview and KPIs
  2. **Loan Analysis** – Insights into loan distribution, risk, and approval patterns
  3. **Deposit Analysis** – Patterns in savings and deposit trends

### 🔹 Canva
- Used to design visual elements and layout for the Power BI dashboard.
